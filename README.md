# Menagerie-Game
# Course
CS1002	Programming Fundamentals

# Description
We are going to make a menagerie where there are different animals. We are supposed to let user make a chain of animals of same species and count the number of animals belonging to different species. Please be noted whenever atleast three animals of same species are found by the user (a chain is formed) current animals disappear, count of particular species is increased, and tiles fall from the top to fill in gaps (new animals will replace them). <br />
Our goal is to make as many chains of animal (both in rows and columns and it will be accomplished by swapping position of different animals) as possible but in as few moves as
possible. <br />
• Our intial objective is to make a repository of atleast 8000 animals of 1st species, 7000 animals of 2nd species, 6000 animals of 3rd species, 5000 animals of 4th species, 4000 animals of 5th species and 3000 animals of 6th species. <br />
• As you proceed to the next level of the game, we shall have a time constraint to make the repository. <br />


# Rules

• User can swap one animal with an adjacent animal with the help of mouse to form only horizontal or vertical chain of three or more identical animals. <br />
• Bonus points are given to player when chains of more than three identical animals are formed. <br />
• Bonus points are awarded to player when two chains are formed in one swap. <br />
• Cascades (more than two chains) are also awarded with bonus points. <br />
• There should be a specific number of moves allowed to go to next level. <br />
• Game is over when there are no more moves left. <br />
